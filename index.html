    <h1>Carena</h1>
    <p>
      A lightweight scene-tree for use with html5's canvas.
    </p>
    <h2>Core Features</h2>
    <p>
      Carena's core feature-set is currently very minimal, providing only a small set methods:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>carena.applyProperties(obj, props)</strong>
          <p>
            All properties from the props argument are copied onto the obj, allowing for the copying of enumerable getters/setters.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>carena.Erect(structure, features)</strong>
          <p>
            Builds a tree with a common set of features. (Still under r&amp;d)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>carena.Build(obj, features, options)</strong>
          <p>
            Builds an object to your specifications. <strong>obj</strong> is your original object that you want to build on top of.  <strong>features</strong> is an array of carena enabled features (for a list see the Dynamic Features section below). <strong>options</strong> is simply an object that gets passed to every feature that is used to build your new object.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>carena.Design(obj, features, options)</strong>
          <p>
            Use carena.Design for building a factory that builds nodes that share the same features.  The signature is exactly the same as <strong>carena.Build</strong>, except for the fact that it returns a function that also has the same signature, and behaves exactly like <strong>carena.Build</strong>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>carena.commonAncestor(obj1, obj2)</strong> (Will move soon!)
          <p>
            This method finds the common ancestor between two nodes. Example
<pre>
   [a]
   / \
[b]  [c]
    /   \
  [d]   [e]
</pre>
            The common ancestor of <strong>d</strong> and <strong>e</strong> in the previous example is <strong>c</strong>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Dynamic Features</h2>
    <p>
      Dynamic features are used to augment the features of an existing object.  There are two ways to apply the following features to your objects.<br />
      <br />
      1. Utilize the carena.Build() method; this is generally done by calling carena.build(obj, [carena.feature.{feature1}, carena.feature.{feature2}]).  This will return you your original `obj` augmented with feature1 and feature 2<br />
      <br />
      2. If you want to add a single feature to an object, you can do so easily by: carena.feature.feature1(obj).  `obj` will be augmented with methods and properties from the feature and returned to you.
    </p>
    <h3>Node</h3>
    <p>
      The Node feature provides basic functionality including:
      <ul>
        <li>positioning (x,y,z)</li>
        <li>dimensions (height, width)</li>
        <li>bounding box (bounds.x, bounds.y)</li>
        <li>tree navigation (walk, ascend, descend, parent, children, child)</li>
        <li>tree management (add, remove)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3>Eventable</h3>
    <p>
      The Eventable feature provides a means for objects to communicate via events.<br />
      
      Eventable is attached to objects by way of a namespace property "event".  All methods useful to event capabilities are nested under the event namespace.
    </p>
    <p>
      These capabilities include:
      <ul>
        <li>bind</li>
        <li>unbind</li>
        <li>trigger</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Many events are namespaced for organization's sake.  Examples of namespaced events are "node.x", "node.parent", "drag.start", etc..<br />
      <br />
      When binding or triggering events, you may trigger by the entire name or by namespace. For example, If you bound to "node.*" the following events would be caught:
      <ul>
        <li>node.x</li>
        <li>node.y</li>
        <li>node.arbitrary.namespace.event</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
