          we are building something like

  [ drop manager ]   [ node ]       [ drop ]

              [ drag1 ]     [ drag2 ]

          nodes from the left branch can be dropped into the right

          Here is how this works:
            * camera binds to '*' events, and re-triggers them internally

            TODO: determine where the camera's children come into play
                  idealy we won't bubble all the way up to the root of the tree,
                  but instead handle it in the camera, somehow.
